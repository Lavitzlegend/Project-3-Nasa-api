## Preview

This is our take on a Workout tracking and sharing app.

## Technology Used

- Vanilla javascript, css, and html
- NodeJS, Sequelize, pg, express, ejs, method-override, dotenv
- Embedded Youtube videos
- Linked a font from fonts.googleapis.
- Heroku hosted server and database

## Theory

We wanted to create an app where any user can sign up, login, and track their fitness journey. We utilized two separate tables named Workouts and Users that have a many to many relationship. They work through a JOIN table called UserWorkouts that will display on the user's profile page all the workouts they have added to the JOIN table.

A workout can be added to the workouts index page where you would enter the name, description, and an embed link to a YouTube video of the activity/exercise. Once a new workout is added it will show in the dropdown selector on the user's profile page.

Combining the above tables gives the user a way to keep a history of all the workouts they've done as well as challenging themselves by trying out workouts other users have created. This way you can track your own progress as well as participate in a larger fitness community.
   
## How The Join Table Works

On the users profile they have a drop down with all the workouts added to the Workouts table. Once they select one from the drop down and press the Add Selected Workout button it runs the addWorkout function inside the users.js controller which does a foundUser.addWorkout(foundWorkout). This method is available because of the belongsToMany associations detailed in the workout.js and user.js models.
   
## Main Features

- Landing page links to login or create an account and takes you to the respective EJS files
- Using text and password inputs with req.body to pass them into their respective tables
- Profile page utilizes a few for-loops to display all the workouts in the Workout table as well as all the workouts tied to the current userId in the JOIN table
- BelongsToMany associations for both User and Workout classes
- Migration and seeder files to ensure Tables are correct in the database and that there are some workouts in the the table to choose initially
- YouTube embed links show as embedded videos in the workout show page
- package.json file has the required node module dependencies
- MVC architecture utilized for correct express and sequelize functionality
- Foreign and other keys to link the userId and workoutId primary keys
- Unique constraint added to JOIN table so the user cannot add the same workout twice

## User Stories

1. I want to see the homepage when I go to the URL
2. I should be able to signup as a new user
3. I should be able to login to my profile page as an existing user 
4. I should see how long my account has been active 
5. I want to see a list of all possible workouts 
6. I should be able to add to the “My Workouts” section of my profile a new workout
7. I want to have a link to any workouts added to My Workouts to see more info about that workout and/or edit the workout
8. There should be a link to an index page of all workouts with a link to create a new workout
9. I should be able to view the workout video without leaving the workout profile page
10. I should be able to logout
11. ACCORDING TO OUR "LEADER", THE PASSWORD SHOULD NOT BE DISPLAYED, lol


## What's left?

- The user can add an infinite number of unique workouts so the My Workouts section will continue down forever
- It would be better if the My Workouts were sorted by recently added instead of by workoutId
- Should be able to edit or remove a workout
- Be able to return back to the user profile page, after viewing the list of available workouts

## Challenges
- Accessing the user from a page that did not have the user's profile id
- Accesssing the join table directly
- Including images rather than links without restructuring the code (routes??)
- Coding with a collaborator

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
